1. Open repo in VSCode
2. use menv as Python interpreter
  pip install anything needed

3. export FLASK_APP=webapp.py
4. python MyServer2.py --> then click on URL to deploy locally
    python MyServer3.py for grabbing template
    python Pred2Server.py for deploying basic prediction script
- tutorial_edits / hello_app has proper, basic structure for producing page with three pages
  - follow these and have one page for each of three scripts probably
  -  tutorial_2 not working for some reason, neither is Python interpreter
    - may need to delete and add back in before running

Debugging MyServer3.py
- Click to left of code line to establish red dot
- Hit run and Debug --> create a launch.json file
    - "module: flask" tells debugger to run python file as Flask
    - ensure app name is file we want to debug
    - Save json
    - Run and debug tab: hit green arrow
        - Before page renders, VS Code pauses program at breakpoint set

- If using '/<name>':
    - instead of clicking URL, paste into browser with /Alex at end


Pred2Server.py
- run it same as MyServer2.py, except it prints out a prediction

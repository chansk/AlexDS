# AlexDS
This repository will give examples of DS work. Specifically, we will predict the stock price of Apple using regression.

1. Use Python to predict Apple stock price from live data feed.
  - Apple's closing price is being tracked from Jan 1, 2010, through the most recent trading day's closing price to use for predictions. Updated daily!
2. Using EC2, serve the model in a flask app.
3. Chron job to automate input, preprocessing, and prediction.
